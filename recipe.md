Blend up a batch of my 6-ingredient basil pesto, or use store-bought pesto in a pinch.
Cook your pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water according to the package directions.
Before draining the pasta, reserve some of the starchy pasta water. Then, add 1/4 cup of this pasta water back into the pot with your pesto, and stir to thin the pesto.
Toss in the cooked pasta, and mix until the pesto thoroughly coats it.
Add a big handful of arugula and toss until itâ€™s barely wilted.
Finish everything with a big squeeze of lemon, salt, pepper, red pepper flakes, and toasted pine nuts.
